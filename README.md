*DESCRIPTION*:As part of the UI/UX Design task, the objective was to create a user interface for an AR/VR application, with a particular focus on intuitive user interactions. The deliverable expected from the task was a set of mockups or prototypes that demonstrate the interface design. Keeping this in mind, I chose to design a Virtual Reality (VR) Gaming Application Interface that is both user-friendly and immersive, while staying within the scope of UI/UX design.

The concept revolves around a simple, clean, and intuitive interface that allows users to explore and preview multiple VR games. The first screen displays a collection of game cards arranged in a layout that is suitable for VR viewing — centered in the user’s field of vision and within comfortable reach. A forward navigation arrow, placed at the bottom center of the screen, allows users to browse through additional games beyond the first set. This ensures that the user can interact with the content naturally, using gaze or pointing-based interactions, which are common in VR environments.

Upon selecting any game card, the user is taken to a game detail screen, which presents the title and a brief description of the selected game. This screen offers users context about the game they are about to play. While a “Play” button is visible in the UI design, it does not lead to another screen or game environment, as the task specifically required designing the interface rather than implementing game logic or extended navigation. However, a “Go Back” button is included on the detail screen, allowing the user to return seamlessly to the previous screen containing the list of games. This interaction reflects a basic yet essential pattern in user-centered design — giving users control and the ability to reverse actions without confusion.

The interface design was first prototyped using Figma, which allowed me to design the layout, icons, buttons, and transitions between the home screen and the detail screen. Each element was created with clarity and visibility in mind — ensuring that the buttons are sized appropriately for VR environments and positioned within the optimal viewing zone (central 60° of vision). The visual hierarchy was kept simple so that users can easily distinguish between primary actions (like selecting a game) and secondary actions (like going back).

To simulate how the interface would appear and behave in a virtual environment, I used Draft XR, which helped convert the 2D design into a VR-friendly format. This tool allowed me to validate the spatial positioning of elements and get a realistic preview of how users might interact with the interface while wearing a VR headset. Even though building the full functionality of each game was not required, the immersive context provided by Draft XR gave a clearer picture of how the UI would function in a real-world VR setting.

The overall focus was to keep interactions natural, simple, and accessible. No complex gestures or unnecessary animations were added to avoid confusion or fatigue. Users are only required to gaze, click, or point — which are standard and intuitive interactions in most consumer VR devices today. Additionally, by including only the necessary navigation elements, the design maintains a minimalist aesthetic that keeps users focused on the content rather than the interface.

In conclusion, this project fulfills the core requirement of the task: creating a user interface for a VR application that focuses on intuitive interaction. The mockups and prototypes demonstrate a clear navigation path, spatial awareness, and user-friendly controls. The additional use of Draft XR enhances the delivery by placing the design in an immersive VR context, even though the task only required mockups. By thoughtfully designing every element of the interface and validating it within a VR simulation, this project successfully bridges the gap between visual design and spatial user experience.
